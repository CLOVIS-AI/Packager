Packager support [Raco](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/), the [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/) package manager.

??? note "Why don't I get the option to use Yarn?"
    If this backend does not appear in the choices, run the following command to understand why:
    ```shell
    packager-raco enabled
    ```
    If the command is not found, check your installation.
    Otherwise, it should print the reason why it doesn't appear.
