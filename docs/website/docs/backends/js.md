Packager supports both [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

??? note "Why don't I get the option to use NPM?"
    If this backend does not appear in the choices, run the following command to understand why:
    ```shell
    packager-npm enabled
    ```
    If the command is not found, check your installation.
    Otherwise, it should print the reason why it doesn't appear.

??? note "Why don't I get the option to use Yarn?"
    If this backend does not appear in the choices, run the following command to understand why:
    ```shell
    packager-yarn enabled
    ```
    If the command is not found, check your installation.
    Otherwise, it should print the reason why it doesn't appear.
